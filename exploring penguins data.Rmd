## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## About the data
Data were collected and made available by [Dr.
Kristen Gorman] (https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station Antarctica
LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/),a member of the Long Term Ecological Research
Network.
The original palmerpenguins data contains
morphological information on 244 individuals of
three penguin species (152 individuals of Adelie
penguins, 68 individuals of Gentoo penguins, and
124 individuals of Chinstrap penguins).
